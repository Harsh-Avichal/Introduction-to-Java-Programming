/*
    5.1  A pentagonal number is defined as n(3nâ€“1)/2 for n = 1 ,2...
         and so on. Therefore, the first few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, . . ..
         Write a method with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:

       --> public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)

         Write a test program that uses this method to display the first 100 pentagonal
         numbers with 10 numbers on each line.
